2. Google Maps is revolutionary and has changed the way we see navigation. It is the mostt popular navigation app by a wide margin (67%). It has features like, satellite and street view. You can see exact coordinates, plan trips with multiple stops, and a bunch of various/endless features that are useful. 

Youtube has a recommended video algorithm. Whenever you watch a few videos of a similar topic, Youtube recognizes it and starts pushing/recommending videos of that topic on your front page. Youtube tends to group interested topics together. 

Facebook has an algorithm for their timeline. They have algorithms for their ads that show on your timeline (which is kind of creepy) and there's an algorithm that knows which status' and posts for you to see on your timeline. It takes into account who you talk to and interact with the most and it also knows what you've been searching (sometimes thinking) which is why they can push an ad on your feed even if you've only mentioned it once in person. 

3. To me, an efficient algorithm is one that that predicts what the user wants. An efficient algorithm kind of has to be one step ahead of the user, knowing what they already will do/think. Therefore, it'll give the user what they want. An inefficient algorithm is something that kind of annoys the user than helps the user. It doesn't give the user what they want/it's hard to give the user what they want.
